                    I love hardware stores and happily visit them while on vacation or 
                    at a convention.  A recent vacation to Las Vegas for the National 
                    Hardware Show was a deductible way to learn about new products and 
                    techniques. A quality tool with a unique feature will get a trial. 
                    Those that are at the top of their class have a life on a basement 
                    or garage workbench. So the following pictures are of quality tools 
                    that have gotten upgraded from, or are duplicates.</div>

                <div class="sale saleDescription">
                    These good quality saw horses have a sacrificial 2 x 4 screwed to the 
                    top to extend the height and allow a circular saw to pass through 
                    without dulling the blade.<br />
                    Has eyelets to hang from the joist when not in use.<br />
                    One leg has a magnet to prevent the legs from unfolding when not desired.<br />

                <div class="sale saleTitle">Vintage Leather Shop collection (stamps, tools, and hides) from the '70s</div>
                <div class="sale saleDescription">
                    <p>Everything you'd need, including the hides and tutorials, to start and run 
                        a custom leather shop!</p>
                    <p>One of the college dorms ran leather workshops next to the ceramics studio. 
                       I picked up the craft and made a living selling belts, purses, hats, 
                       wristbands, and a few garments. The money was in making and selling belts and 
                       wristbands with a name. Carving purses and bags was the artistic side, but 
                       the time required for the detail that makes a fine bag didn't pay the rent.
                       Cash in the pocket didn't last long in those days, but Tandy Leather was 
                       located between work (Village Cab Company in Oak Park) and home. I'd buy a 
                       leather stamp or carving guide that I didn't have so that someday I may 
                       create thousands of quality leather items. Turning a hobby into a business 
                       was not the end of the rainbow; the real job(s) lasted decades. The hobby 
                       came back every holiday season as special-order named belts and wristbands 
                       meant very good cheer for both customers and myself for decades.  In the 
                       '90s the new hobby became home repair, and those tools and materials 
                       squeezed the leather shop into boxes. I'd pull things out occasionally to 
                       rivet a carpenter's tool pouch or add a hole in a belt (too much of the  
                       latter going on). Then one day I went by and thought I heard the tools 
                       calling me.  When I opened the box they said, "Help! We're trapped in here 
                       and want to be used! Find us someone who will appreciate our quality and 
                       vintage character!"</p>
                    <p>So, the leather workshop is for sale.</p>
                    <p>Most of the items are still available at 
                        <a href="http://www.tandyleatherfactory.com" target="_new">Tandy Leather</a>. 
                        The following categories at Tandy have many items that are in my collection:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lacing</li>
                        <li>Leather</li>
                        <li>Leathercraft Books</li>
                        <li>Leathercraft Patterns</li>
                        <li>Leathercraft Projects</li>

                        <li>Tools</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>More than half of the stamps, tools, or craftaids, as well as DIY tutorials that 
                        worked as a '70s version of YouTube are here waiting for the next leather 
                        craftsman.
                    </p>
                    <p>Retail value of this collection is in the $6k - $7k range.</p>
