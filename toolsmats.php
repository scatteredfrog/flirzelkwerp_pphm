                    I love hardware stores and happily visit them while on vacation or 
                    at a convention.  A recent vacation to Las Vegas for the National 
                    Hardware Show was a deductible way to learn about new products and 
                    techniques. A quality tool with a unique feature will get a trial. 
                    Those that are at the top of their class have a life on a basement 
                    or garage workbench. So the following pictures are of quality tools 
                    that have gotten upgraded from, or are duplicates.</div>

                       The Worm Factory 360 composter uses worms to break down organic 
                        waste. Its compact design makes it perfect to use in any 
                        household.<br />
                        It is easy to recycle kitchen scraps and paper into nutrient-rich 
                        fertilizer for your plants.<br />
                        Managing the Worm Factory 360 takes less than 15 minutes a week. 
                        Add worms and your organic waste to the bottom tray. Once that tray 
                        is filled add another. The worms migrate upward leaving their 
                        compost behind. It works year-round inside or outside.<br />
                        The finished compost can be used on any plants.<br />

                            <li>"It's a wonder using the Worm Factory to teach kids that most of what they have in life can be
recycled." -- Susan W., Poplar Road Elementary</li>
                            <li>"This product is a wonderful addition to anyone practicing organic gardening. The worm castings
are easy to harvest and are a priceless addition to flower pots." -- Gretchen B., National Gardening Club</li>
                            <li>"Absolutely no smell or mess. I have mine in the kitchen! It's great to have the worms at work all
                                winter in NE New York, and not have to schlep the compost to the pile, awaiting the spring thaw. I love this product!" -- K. Kotarski, National Gardening Club</li>
                            <li>"I have had the product working for a couple of months now and love it. Based on design, ease of use and appearance, I have recommended this product to several fellow gardeners. I have
always thought I did a good job recycling and composting, but this has raised that to a new level and I now use items such as newspaper and paper towels for my worms that would either been
recycled or thrown in the trash. Coming up with food "recipes" is quite fun." -- Sue F.</li>

                        These covers for half round windows are temporary and removable. 
                        Having them custom-made and installed would cost hundreds of dollars 
                        each. Our much more affordable options are made using temporary vinyl 
                        window coverings from the box stores and have been in use for at least 
                        four years. These window covers reduce middle-of-summer heat gain but 
                        do not block out all the light. When winter comes or if you want to 
                        let in evening light during warmer times of year, the covers are easy to 
                        remove.<br />
                        Price: $49 each<br />
                        $125 to measure, deliver, and install.<br />
                        Windows pictured are 38 inches in diameter (19 inches tall). When closed, 
                        the covering sits on the sill and is 1.5 inches by 1.5 inches by 18.5 
                        inches.<br />

                        <p>Everything you'd need, including the hides and tutorials, to start and run 
                            a custom leather shop!</p>
                        <p>One of the college dorms ran leather workshops next to the ceramics studio. 
                           I picked up the craft and made a living selling belts, purses, hats, 
                           wristbands, and a few garments. The money was in making and selling belts and 
                           wristbands with a name. Carving purses and bags was the artistic side, but 
                           the time required for the detail that makes a fine bag didn't pay the rent.
                           Cash in the pocket didn't last long in those days, but Tandy Leather was 
                           located between work (Village Cab Company in Oak Park) and home. I'd buy a 
                           leather stamp or carving guide that I didn't have so that someday I may 
                           create thousands of quality leather items. Turning a hobby into a business 
                           was not the end of the rainbow; the real job(s) lasted decades. The hobby 
                           came back every holiday season as special-order named belts and wristbands 
                           meant very good cheer for both customers and myself for decades.  In the 
                           '90s the new hobby became home repair, and those tools and materials 
                           squeezed the leather shop into boxes. I'd pull things out occasionally to 
                           rivet a carpenter's tool pouch or add a hole in a belt (too much of the  
                           latter going on). Then one day I went by and thought I heard the tools 
                           calling me.  When I opened the box they said, "Help! We're trapped in here 
                           and want to be used! Find us someone who will appreciate our quality and 
                           vintage character!"</p>
                        <p>So, the leather workshop is for sale.</p>
