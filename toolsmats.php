                    I love hardware stores and happily visit them while on vacation or 
                    at a convention.  A recent vacation to Las Vegas for the National 
                    Hardware Show was a deductible way to learn about new products and 
                    techniques. A quality tool with a unique feature will get a trial. 
                    Those that are at the top of their class have a life on a basement 
                    or garage workbench. So the following pictures are of quality tools 
                    that have gotten upgraded from, or are duplicates.</div>

                       The Worm Factory 360 composter uses worms to break down organic

                        household.<br />
                        It is easy to recycle kitchen scraps and paper into nutrient-rich 
                        fertilizer for your plants.<br />
                        Managing the Worm Factory 360 takes less than 15 minutes a week. 
                        Add worms and your organic waste to the bottom tray. Once that tray 
                        is filled add another. The worms migrate upward leaving their 
                        compost behind. It works year-round inside or outside.<br />
                        The finished compost can be used on any plants.<br />

                        These covers for half round windows are temporary and removable. 
                        Having them custom-made and installed would cost hundreds of dollars 
                        each. Our much more affordable options are made using temporary vinyl 
                        window coverings from the box stores and have been in use for at least 
                        four years. These window covers reduce middle-of-summer heat gain but 
                        do not block out all the light. When winter comes or if you want to 
                        let in evening light during warmer times of year, the covers are easy to 
                        remove.<br />
                        Price: $49 each<br />
                        $125 to measure, deliver, and install.<br />
                        Windows pictured are 38 inches in diameter (19 inches tall). When closed, 
                        the covering sits on the sill and is 1.5 inches by 1.5 inches by 18.5 
                        inches.<br />

                    Vintage Leather Shop collection from the '70s</div>
                <div id="leather-stuff" class="saleOtherStuff">
                    <div class="sale saleDescription">
                        <p>Everything you'd need, including the hides and tutorials, to start and run 
                            a custom leather shop!</p>
                        <p>One of the college dorms ran leather workshops next to the ceramics studio. 
                           I picked up the craft and made a living selling belts, purses, hats, 
                           wristbands, and a few garments. The money was in making and selling belts and 
                           wristbands with a name. Carving purses and bags was the artistic side, but 
                           the time required for the detail that makes a fine bag didn't pay the rent.
                           Cash in the pocket didn't last long in those days, but Tandy Leather was 
                           located between work (Village Cab Company in Oak Park) and home. I'd buy a 
                           leather stamp or carving guide that I didn't have so that someday I may 
                           create thousands of quality leather items. Turning a hobby into a business 
                           was not the end of the rainbow; the real job(s) lasted decades. The hobby 
                           came back every holiday season as special-order named belts and wristbands 
                           meant very good cheer for both customers and myself for decades.  In the 
                           '90s the new hobby became home repair, and those tools and materials 
                           squeezed the leather shop into boxes. I'd pull things out occasionally to 
                           rivet a carpenter's tool pouch or add a hole in a belt (too much of the  
                           latter going on). Then one day I went by and thought I heard the tools 
                           calling me.  When I opened the box they said, "Help! We're trapped in here 
                           and want to be used! Find us someone who will appreciate our quality and 
                           vintage character!"</p>
                        <p>So, the leather workshop is for sale.</p>
                        <p>Most of the items are still available at 
                            <a href="http://www.tandyleatherfactory.com" target="_blank">Tandy Leather</a>.

                        </p>
                        <p>More than half of the stamps, tools, or craftaids, as well as DIY tutorials that 
                            worked as a '70s version of YouTube are here waiting for the next leather 
                            craftsman.
