                    <td><h3>Jane's Story</h3><p>
                        Jane is a quiet, cat-loving woman with many large books in her home. It wouldn't surprise 
                        me if she has read -- and understood -- almost all of those tomes. Jane isn't loud, 
                        abrasive, confrontational, or in any other way unpleasant; she also has fewer gray hairs  
                        than I do. Jane called me in mid-October 2012. She needed a door to be cut down and a 
                        threshold installed.</p>
                        <p>
                        Jane had hired someone to remodel her bathroom. The remodeler installed a tile floor, and
                        <ul>
                            <li>left the raw edge of tile and globs of adhesive tapes exposed, and</li>
                            <li>because of the thickness of the tile, the bathroom door couldn't be put back on.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        A company, previously thought to be reputable, sold Jane a new bathroom sink, toilet, 
                        medicine cabinet, and tile floor. They sent someone to take measurements and arranged the 
                        installation. The crew that installed the tile didn't tell Jane that she would need a 
                        threshold (transition strip), nor could they shave the door to refit it in the hinges, 
                        bringing up some curious questions:<ul>
                            <li>Someone who makes a living remodeling bathrooms doesn't know that a transition 
                                strip is necessary after setting ceramic tile on an existing floor?</li>
                            <li>Someone who makes a living installing flooring can't install a transition strip?</li>
                            <li>Someone who makes a living installing tile isn't able to shave a door?</li>
                            <li>Who would let a customer suddenly go without a bathroom door?</li>
                        </ul></p><p>
                        The company Jane hired should not have left her with an unfinished floor and without a 
                        bathroom door. I offered to talk to a company representative on her behalf, but Jane 
                        didn't want to go there. The installation, scheduling, and, well, the whole experience 
                        had been unpleasant. She wanted to put it all behind her and move on. I remember wishing 
                        I could be that strong (or that smart).</p>
                        <p>
                        For the transition strip, I purchased two moldings, which I combined, trimmed to fit, 
                        stained, and installed. I shaved the door, sealed the bottom of it to prevent warping, 
                        and put it back on its hinges.</p>
                        <p>
                        Unfortunately, the door would not close because the new toilet's elongated bowl was in the 
                        way. Jane called the aforementioned company's manager, who offered to sell her a different 
                        toilet and only charge her half for the repeat installation. Jane let me talk to the manager, 
                        but he didn't want to talk to me. (Can't blame him.) I finished the other things on Jane's 
                        to-do list and met a friend for lunch. The plan was for me to return to hang the door and 
                        some new towel bars after the toilet was changed.</p>
                        <p>
                        The store Jane was originally dealing with was on my way home, so I offered to stop and
                        personally speak with the manager. Jane agreed and gave me a piece of paper with her phone 
                        number, purchase order number, and written permission to allow me to speak on her behalf.
                        When I arrived, a different manager -- the afternoon manager -- was on duty. He listened to
                        the details and agreed that a customer who purchased a bathroom remodel should not be left
                        with ragged exposed tiles, and should have a bathroom door that would close. He said he'd 
                        contact the installation department and "get back to me." (He didn't.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The store changed the toilet (and charged $200), and I went back to Jane's to install a 
                        towel bar, toilet paper holder, switch cover plate, and a knob for the medicine cabinet.</p>
                        <p>
                        While installing the knob, I found that the medicine cabinet was loose. There were two 
                        &frac14;-inch spaces between the cabinet and the wall. The wall was not bowed. The cabinet
                        had been mounted with four drywall screws. No toggles, no screws into studs, no wall 
                        anchors, no shims; just four screws into drywall. I removed and reinstalled the cabinet 
                        using four wall anchors and two screws into studs.
                        </p>

                        <caption>Jane's medicine cabinet had been inexplicably installed improperly -- note the gap 
                            between the cabinet and the

                        There was a golf ball-sized hole where the toilet supply line came through the wall. The hole 
                        previously had been covered by a large vintage baseboard that the installers had removed and 
                        substituted with small contemporary door casings (moldings) less than half the size of the 
                        originals, and quarter round for base shoe. I measured the distance from the wall to the 
                        flange bolt removing one of the caps. More than half the threads inside the nut were visible. 
                        The nut couldn't have been on two whole turns.</p>

                        Chapter 1 of the handyman text warns that the "OMG" phrase does not bring comfort to your 
                        customer. Nonetheless, I let it slip out for the first time in the ten years I've been in 
                        business. Loose bolts and a &frac14;-inch space between the side of the toilet and the 
                        floor...</p>

                        I've been to this store many times and have some of their products in my own home. I've told 
                        customers that the difference between Kmart and Target is like the difference between Home Depot 
                        and this place: most of the same stuff, but some things are a little bit nicer.</p>

                        <p>In summary, what they did to Jane's bathroom was:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Remove vintage baseboard and replace it with incorrectly sized modern door trim</li>
                            <li>Remove vintage base shoe and replace it with quarter round (which sticks out 
                                farther from the wall)</li>
                            <li>Leave a golf ball-sized hole around the toilet's supply line (who knows what 
                                may crawl out!)</li>
                            <li>Not Spackle the nail holes</li>
                            <li>Leave a &frac14;-inch space between the toilet and the floor</li>
                            <li>Install a floor but not finish the job</li>
                            <li>Install a bathroom but no bathroom door</li>
                            <li>Install a medicine cabinet that was loose within a week and certain to fall</li>
                            <li>Charge her an additional fee to reinstall the correct toilet</li>
                        </ul></p>
                        <p>
                        I sent Jane a copy before posting this, and below is her reply:
                        <blockquote><p>
                            Hi, Rich --</p>
                            <p>
                            Much thanks for re-hanging the medicine cabinet and for everything.</p>
                            <p>
                            Please change my name in the editorial. We quiet, cat-loving women like deep cover :o)</p>
                        </blockquote><p>
                        After Thanksgiving, I stopped at the store again and spoke with a fourth manager and gave him 
                        a copy of this letter before launching a "Campaign for Justice" on YouTube.</p>
                        <p>
                        About a week later, I received an e-mail from Jane telling me that the company agreed to issue 
                        a refund of $360.00 that she accepted.</p>
                        <p>
                        Someday a guest may bump that toilet and suddenly the neighbor below has a new water feature 
                        in the ceiling. For $360, the store got off cheap, but Jane got more of a refund than she 
                        expected.</p>
                        <p>
                        Installations by the big box stores come with a hidden cost. Their installation charges are 
                        low and are split at least three ways:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The big box store takes a cut.</li>
                            <li>The company that hires the installer takes its cut.</li>
                            <li>The guy doing the work gets whatever money is left over.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        This built-in incentive to finish and get to the next job may not allow the best quality 
                        for your installation.</p>
