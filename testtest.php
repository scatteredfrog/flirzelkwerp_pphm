                    </center></h3>
        <dl><b>10) Experience.</b> More than 30 years of quality work.<p>
            <b>9) Loyalty.</b> I am in my ninth year of business at the same location, with the same phone number.<p>
            <b>8) Lessons.</b> If you want to learn to do it yourself, I will show you or explain it 
                to you. <a href="http://ccc.edu/colleges/truman/departments/Pages/Continuing-Education.aspx"target="_blank">You
                may click here for information about the classes I teach at Truman College.</a><p>
            <b>7) Trustworthy.</b> Being licensed and insured, maintaining your trust is paramount to me. You will not have to
                count your silverware when I leave your home; if you leave your wallet, credit card, bank book, or a large pile 
                of cash on your counter, <u>I will not touch them</u>. (I only ask that you please don't leave the cookies
                out!)<p>
            <b>6) Preparedness.</b> I always come ready for the task. My work vehicle is not the family sedan, but a stocked van 
                dedicated to the repair profession. I stock fasteners, wall repair goods, a variety of caulk, and the most frequently 
                requested tools and materials in the van. This means fewer trips to the hardware store.<p>
            <b>5) Concern.</b> I'm concerned about protecting your belongings. How many other contractors
                have fleece furniture pads in their toolboxes? And I sweep up after myself.<p>
            <b>4) Service.</b> My history of helpfulness includes spending 20 years as an RN in the Cook County
                Trauma Unit.<p>
            <b>3) Guaranteed results.</b> I guarantee my work for a <u>minimum</u> of one year -- just like the franchises - and I 
                will do everything possible to make sure my customers are satisfied.<p>
            <b>2) Promptness.</b> I return calls as quickly as possible. On the rare occasion that I miss your call, I do appreciate
                reminders, but I'm not that guy who doesn't return your calls.<p>
            <b>1) Care.</b> I work in and on your home with as much care as I would want in and on my own home.</b></dl>
