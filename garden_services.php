                        whether you're starting with a blank canvas or in need of renovation. 
                        I will meet with you and find out about your style, your needs and 
                        wishes for your garden, and how you plan to use it. This will enable 
                        me to design a garden that meets your needs and one that will be 
                        enjoyable for years to come.

                        direction, or advice. I will visit your home, charging an hourly 
                        garden consultation fee. At this time I would listen to your 
                        concerns and wishes for your space, offer suggestions, and answer 
                        your questions. What will you come away with? A list of suggestions 
                        outlined in a way that may enable you to implement the changes 
                        yourself, or an estimate on any tasks you want further 
                        assistance with.

                        This option is for homeowners who enjoy working in their gardens 
                        and may want to work hand in hand alongside a horticulturist in 
                        order to enhance their space and learn while doing so. We can 
                        help you start a herb or vegetable garden; a child's garden with a 
                        place to plant, dig, and play; or a flower bed -- with front yard and 
                        back yard assistance. Want to learn how and when to prune your shrubs, 
                        how to sharpen your garden tools, or how to test and amend your soil? 
                        Are you interested in starting a compost bin, or are you having issues 
                        with an existing bin? Are you interested in vermicompost? Plants need 
                        to be moved or divided? You can tell me what's important to you and 
                        what you hope to gain or learn while working with a garden coach.
