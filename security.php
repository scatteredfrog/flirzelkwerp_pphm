                      A very good way to protect your property is with a dead bolt and double strike 
                      plate.  I use this combination in my home.
                      <br />&nbsp;<br />
                        A strike plate is screwed into the jamb, and the latch of a dead bolt goes into it 
                        to lock the door.
                      <br />&nbsp;<br />

                          <div id="caption_a">
                            This is a standard strike plate with &frac34;-inch screws that go about &frac58;
                            inch into the door jamb.
                          </div>

                              Part of the installation is this double strike plate with four screws.

                              This 3-inch screw goes through the jamb and into the framing member (2x4) 
                              behind the jamb. Note the thickness of the primary strike plate.

                              Here is how everything assembles with both strike plates.

                      If a homeowner wants to change locks, this is worth considering. It will allow you 
                      to have one key for the knob and deadbolt on the front, back, basement, and garage 
                      doors. New homeowners should also consider this security measure.
                      <br />&nbsp;<br />
                      As a handyman, I've been called to repair many doors that have been kicked in. 
                      Burglars often kick doors in to gain access to a home or garage. I've never been 
                      called to repair a door that had a properly installed double dead bolt system. 
                      Consider Rachel's Yelp review:
                      <br />&nbsp;<br />
                      <div id="rachel">Last spring Rich came out to replace locks on my back door and 
                      garage door and took the extra time to do it right so that it would not be easy for 
                      anyone to break in. When I left for work yesterday morning, I could tell someone had 
                      attempted to break into the garage through the side door given the marks and slight 
                      damage to the door exterior. Clearly the thief did not break in and must have moved 
                      on to an easier target. Rich's quality work prevented this [potential] break-in, and 
                      probably saved us a lot of money in potential theft/damage.
                      <br />&nbsp;<br />
